This project was sparked by a conversation I had with the professor of my 
Game Theory & Machine Learning class, Gauthier Gidel. 
We were both feeling frustrated with the amount of glaring cherry picking in 
machine learning papers, and about how incremental results get completely discarded 
as useless, even if they offer important new research insights. Our solution was to
incentivize research blog posts, since they allow smaller results to be published, which 
would help reduce cherry picking and boost the reach of incremental results. 

To do so, we wanted them to be formally recognized as scientific achievements. 
We contacted Sebastien Bubeck (Sr. Principal Research Manager at Microsoft),
Claire Vernade (Research Scientist at DeepMind), and David Dobre
(a friend and a MSc student at Mila). Together, we wrote a proposal to ICLR
proposing they let us organise a new conference track, the Blog Track.
They accepted, and we became inaugural track chairs. Being track chair at such a
huge conference at 24 years of age was an extraordinary experience.

Even though it was the first edition of a blog track for our field, it was a resounding 
success. As inaugural track chairs, we accepted 20 posts out of 61, roughly the size
of the first ICLR conference (which is now one of the big ML conferences). Social media 
was abuzz about this track, with overwhelmingly positive feedback.

Recently, ICLR also asked G. Gidel, D. Dobre and I to lead the blog track for 
a second year. I am looking forward to it, as ICLR will be in Rwanda in 2023, and
I strongly believe in organizing conferences outside of the usual North American
and European venues.
