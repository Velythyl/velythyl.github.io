I have always been interested in teaching. In fact, my first job was "aquatic safety instructor",
which is just a glorified title for "swimming instructor".

Since then, I have taught a number of TA assignments.

- [Operating Systems](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-2245/)
- [Treatment of Megadata](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-6501/)
- [Autonomous Vehicles](https://admission.umontreal.ca/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-6757/)

I have also worked with the [Duckietown Foundation](https://www.duckietown.org/about/duckietown-foundation), whose goal is to
make robotics and autonomy more approachable subjects for learners of all ages, from preschool to grad school.
In fact, I wrote, coded, and QA'd the ["object detection" exercise](https://github.com/duckietown/mooc-exercises/tree/daffy/object-detection) of their MOOC (massively online open class).
