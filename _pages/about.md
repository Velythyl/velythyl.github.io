Hey there! My name is Charlie Gauthier. I'm currently a PhD student @ [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) with [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/) and [Glen Berseth](https://neo-x.github.io/).

I am interested in practical RL, robotics, and vision for robotics. Specifically, I am interested "morphological adaptation" in RL, e.g. training RL for a wide array of robotic morphologies and subsequently adapting zero-shot to a new morphology. 
One of the reasons I work in
learning for robotics 
is because I believe automation is the single most promising way to solve our current climate crisis.

I've recently became enamored with legged robots. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea involving them.

I am also very interested in scientific vulgarization.
I co-created the first ever blogpost track for ML conferences
(see [here]({{'/blog/2022/iclr-bt-2022/' | site.baseurl}})). In the future, 
in addition to my main research work, I'd like to work with "mainstream media"
to vulgarize robotics and deep learning for the general population.

My other computer science interests mainly deal with functional programming and compilation. 
Oh, how I wish I could use [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for
machine learning...

In my spare time I boulder, hangout with friends, got to a lot of techno and jazz events, and write. 
I like learning languages: I speak French and English fluently, I am learning Japanese right now (yes, yes, it's to read manga, don't judge me), 
and I can get by in German.
