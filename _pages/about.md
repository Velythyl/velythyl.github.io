Hey there! My name is Charlie Gauthier. I'm currently a masters' student @ [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) with [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). 
I am starting my PhD with [Liam Paull](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Glen Berseth](https://neo-x.github.io/) in winter 2023.

I am super interested in practical RL, robotics, and vision for robotics. Specifically, I find ways to create autocurricula
to make RL training faster, more generalizable, and/or more reliable. The reason I work in learning for robotics is because I believe automation is the single most useful way to solve our current climate crisis.
See my [blogpost on the subject]() for more insights into my thinking.

I've recently became enamored with legged robots. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea involving them.

I am also very interested in scientific vulgarization. I co-created the first ever blogpost tracl for ML conferences
(see [here]())

My other computer science interests mainly deal with functional programming and compilation. Oh, how I wish I could use [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for
machine learning...

In my spare time I boulder, play Dungeon and Dragons, and write. I like learning languages: I speak French and English fluently, I am learning Japanese right now, and I can get by in German.
