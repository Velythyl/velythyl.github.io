Hey there! My name is Charlie Gauthier. I’m a PhD student @ Mila with Liam Paull. 

I am interested in practical RL and planning for robotics. Specifically, I am interested in “morphological adaptation” in RL, e.g. training a model for a wide array of robotic morphologies and subsequently adapting zero-shot to a new morphology, or developing open-vocabulary reasoning methods that can plan for a wide array of robotic morphologies. 

One of the reasons I work in learning for robotics is because I believe automation is the single most promising way to solve our current climate crisis. 

I am also very interested in scientific vulgarization. I co-created the first ever blogpost track for [ML conferences](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/home/) (not counting Distill, which was its own non-conference thing!). Our track has seen sustained growth at ICLR since the its inception. 

My other computer science interests mainly deal with functional programming and compilation; as I work in ML, this manifests in an unending love for [Jax](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) 

In my spare time I boulder, hangout with friends, got to a lot of techno and jazz events, and write. I like learning languages: I speak French and English fluently, I am learning Japanese right now (yes, yes, it’s to read manga, don’t judge me), and I can get by in German.
