Hey there! My name is Charlie Gauthier. I'm currently a masters' student @ [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) with [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). 
I am starting my PhD with [Liam Paull](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Glen Berseth](https://neo-x.github.io/) in winter 2023.

I am super interested in practical RL, robotics, and vision for robotics. Specifically, I find ways to create autocurricula
to make RL training faster, more generalizable, and/or more reliable. One of the reasons I work in
learning for robotics 
is because I believe automation is the single most useful way to solve our current climate crisis.
See my [blogpost on the subject]({{'/blog/2022/economy-of-scale/' | site.baseurl}}) for more insights into my thinking.

I've recently became enamored with legged robots. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea involving them.

I am also very interested in scientific vulgarization.
I co-created the first ever blogpost track for ML conferences
(see [here]({{'/blog/2022/iclr-bt-2022/' | site.baseurl}})). In the future, 
in addition to my main research work, I'd like to work with "mainstream media"
to vulgarize robotics and deep learning for the general population.

My other computer science interests mainly deal with functional programming and compilation. 
Oh, how I wish I could use [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) for
machine learning...

In my spare time I boulder, play Dungeon and Dragons, and write. 
I like learning languages: I speak French and English fluently, I am learning Japanese right now, 
and I can get by in German.
