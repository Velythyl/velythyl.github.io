Hey there! My name is Charlie Gauthier. I'm currently a masters' student @ Mila with Liam Paull.

I am super interested in practical RL, robotics, and vision for robotics. Specifically, I find ways to create autocurricula
to make RL training faster, more generalizable, and/or more reliable.

I've recently became enamored with legged robots. Hit me up if you have a cool project idea involving them.

My other computer science interests mainly deal with functional programming and compilation. Oh, how I wish I could use Scala for
machine learning...

In my spare time I boulder, play video games, and write. I like learning languages (I am learning Japanese right now). Finally, I am an absolute DnD fiend.
