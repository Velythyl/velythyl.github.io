I had the pleasure of participating in the 2022 Mila Robotics Summer School. Lots of great
speakers, nice students, and great talks.

Over three days, we developed a control policy for a robot dog. We then rolled it out quite a few times, trying to fine tune it.
On the final day, we had a competition: who can reach a designated goal while avoiding a foam obstacle?

Well. I wish I could say we did well, but our robot just sort of... died... the day of the competition.

Still, this was an incredible experience and I strongly recommend next year's edition to anyone interested in learning for robotics! 
You don't need to be an ML expert, robotics monkey, or math genius :)
