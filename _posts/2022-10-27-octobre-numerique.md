I was invited to present at [IVADO's Digital Octobre event](https://ivado.ca/en/events/ivado-digital-october-2022/).

This event was shock-full of the new generation of researchers in the Comp. Sci., Psychology, Medical, Biologogy and Physics/Astrophysics fields in Montreal.
All of the invited speakers worked with ML as part of the research they presented at the event. Super cool to see!

I presented a subset of my master's thesis during a 15 minute presentation. 
The goal was to vulgarize my research as much as possible.
This work hasn't been published yet, so I can't really go into much details, but I can say that it deals
with robustifying reinforcement learning for quadruped robots.
You can look at [my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WseemCwGYg1pdZx7lHDFR5czjfosMkSFxXDEUTMup0U/edit?usp=sharing) 
if you are really curious.

My presentation was judged first place for my category and, thanks to [Videns Analytics](https://www.vidensanalytics.com/), I was awarded a 1000$ prize! <img style='display:inline; height:2em;' src='/assets/img/emojis/60fps_parrot.gif'>
